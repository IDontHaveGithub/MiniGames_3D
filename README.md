# MiniGames_3D
multiple 3D games

This was just an exercise for school, for the entire semester we would work on the basic of the physics in the 3D world of unity.
We had gotten information of how to easily jump, how the wheeldcolliders works and the physics material should help with things, but after that we were left to our own devices. I jokingly put nonsensical sounds under a couple of the levels, which you can only reach through the levelselect, as it's just a show of how the physics work and it's fun to see a car roll over or fall from the world itself.
In order of levels:
   
   - Marble box: a not really a game, but only physics, you shoot off the red ball with the Spacebar and reset it with Escape, if you press Spacebar a couple of times in quick succession the ball shoots off into space, the blue balls will you scatter around and bounce weirdly of the walls.
  - Chad: Chad is the name of the little toycar you can control, it just drives real bad, but has fun anyway. If it turns over the lights will flicker, but it will reset in a few seconds to happily drive off again.
  - Boing: you're a marble again, or actually more of a bouncyball. Steering can only be done if you're touching the floor with A and D. You jump with Spacebar. after 30 second or so platforms will start moving, after another 30 second more platforms will go and so on.
  - Sumo: The sumo part is actually kinda fun to play, it's controls are wonky and stopping is hard, but that makes it kinda charming. you control the game with WASD and the Arrow keys for the other player. it speeds up fast and if they touch each other they will get launched with a bang.The point system does work and even gets reset if you get into the game again, from the menu.
